# KMeans Clustering Interface
Application to demonstrate the iterative process of K-Means Clustering.  

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that groups objects into clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster, assigning objects to the nearest centroid based on their features. One drawback of the algorithm is its performance can be affected by the initial placement of centroids, potentially leading to suboptimal clustering results.
